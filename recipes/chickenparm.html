  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Quick and easy chicken parmesian on grilled cheese sandwich.</p>
  <h2>Indgredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
    2 frozen breaded chicken patties (such as Tyson®)
</li>
<li>
    2 tablespoons garlic butter, or to taste
</li>
<li>
    4 slices Italian bread
</li>
<li>
    1 cup marinara sauce
</li>
<li>
    ½ teaspoon dried basil, or to taste
</li>
<li>
    1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste
</li>
<li>
    6 thin slices provolone cheese
</li>
<li>
    2 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese
    </li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place chicken patties on a baking sheet.
</li>
<li>
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and crispy, about 20 minutes. Cut chicken patties in half lengthwise.
</li>
<li>
Spread garlic butter onto 1 side of each bread slice.
</li>
<li>
Mix marinara sauce, basil, and garlic salt together in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until warmed, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Stir.
</li>
<li>
Place 1 bread slice, butter-side down, into a skillet; top with 2 slices provolone cheese, 1 tablespoon marinara sauce, 2 chicken patty halves, overlapped to cover bread, 2 tablespoons marinara sauce, 1 slice provolone cheese, and bread, butter-side up. Cook over medium heat until bread is crisp and cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
</li>
<li>
Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over remaining marinara sauce and serve alongside each sandwich.
